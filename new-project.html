        They are… playful? Well, this lion is at least! Meet Cameron, a lion who lives at Big Cat Rescue, 
          which is a feline sanctuary with headquarters in Tampa, Florida. Cameron is a very special, 
        and very playful lion, who enjoys spending a good chunk of time with his toys.</p></li>
        <li> <p>And his very favorite toy is a special yellow donut that he just can’t get enough of.
          It’s perfect for chewing, tossing, and rolling around with, 
          and Cameron so loved playing with his donut that he chewed a hole right through it.
           But don’t worry, readers! All is not lost!

               <li> <p>First things first — big cats are a group of animals that share some similar traits. 
              The big cat group includes animals like tigers, leopards, and of course, lions. 
              But lions are the only big cats that have a lot of bushy hair around their 
              face and neck called a mane. It’s only the adult male lions, too. Female lions (also known as 
              lionesses) don’t have manes.This makes it easy to tell the male lions from the female ones </p></li>
